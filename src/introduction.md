# Unofficial Notes and Resources on Neorg

While diving into the Neorg project, I have accumulated a number of notes and links. As with any large project, it takes a while to get oriented, and sometimes it is beneficial to see someone else's notes. Due to the open-source nature of the project, it is especially useful to keep a collection of all relevant links in one place.

## Disclaimer

This site does not constitute official documentation, nor are these notes endorsed by any person or organization. These are my personal notes that I wrote while getting oriented with Neorg, and I have chosen to make them public in the hope that someone else may find them useful.
