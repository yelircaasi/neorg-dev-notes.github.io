# Background Knowledge

This covers some of what I would consider useful to know when working with Neorg & co.
Most of the sections are in the form of 'learning roadmaps' - some key readings to get up to speed, sometimes also activities or questions to guide one's acquisition of the material.

4. [Learn Racket in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/racket/) - Racket is closely related to Scheme, so this is a good way to get a feel for the language - just don't memorize all the the details here; focus on generalities
5. [nice little video course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byofGyW2L10&list=PLgyU3jNA6VjRMB-LXXR9ZWcU3-GCzJPm0)
6. [Official Guide](https://docs.scheme.org/guide/) - very well-written and worth reading - not too long
7. [Cookbook](https://cookbook.scheme.org/) - one of the better ways to get a feel for the language
8. [Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days](https://docs.scheme.org/tyscheme/) - probably more than is needed for the small amount of Scheme used in Neorg, but well-written and worth leafing through

### Zig

5. [The Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/) - another nice format, and the third member of the Holy Trinity of Rust books

### Haskell

1. [Learn Haskell in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/haskell/) - worth going through for exposure to Haskell syntax
2. [Hyperpolyglot](https://hyperpolyglot.org/ml) - good examples of  basic tasks, even if the other 3 languages are unfamiliar
3. [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) - a classic
4. [Happy Learn Haskell Tutorial](http://www.happylearnhaskelltutorial.com/contents.html) -  another highly recommended resource
5. [Real-World Haskell](https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) - worth going through to solidify what has already been learned and to go from theory to practice

### Dart (â†’ Flutter)

1. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/https-medium-com-rahman-sameeha-whats-flutter-an-intro-to-dart-6fc42ba7c4a3/) - very basic
