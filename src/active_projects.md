the official specification of Norg file syntax and semantics: the One Source of Truth

* [neorg-dirman](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg-dirman) - 
a directory manager for Neorg, a core module which provides a basic interface for workspaces

## Parsers, Treesitter

* [zig-norg](https://github.com/vhyrro/zig-norg) - 
Norg parser written in zig; an API to interface with the .norg file format

rust library for parsing entire directories of Norg files in a multithreaded fashion

* [neorg-haskell-parser](https://github.com/Simre1/neorg-haskell-parser) -

a Julia parser for .norg files, currently targeting HTML
